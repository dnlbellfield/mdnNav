Links 1
In this task we want you to help fill in the links on our Whales information page:

The first link should be linked to a page called whales.html, which is in the 
same directory as the current page.

We'd also like you to give it a tooltip when moused over that tells
 the user that the page includes information on Blue Whales and Sperm Whales.

The second link should be turned into a link you can click to open 
up an email in the user's default mail application, with the recipient 
set as "whales@example.com".

You'll get a bonus point if you also set it so that the 
subject line of the email is automatically filled in as "Question about Whales".

Note: The first link in the example has the target="_blank" attribute
 set on it, so that when you click on it, it opens the page in a new tab. 
 This is not strictly best practice, but we've done it here so that the 
 page doesn't open in the embedded <iframe>, getting rid of your example code
  in the process!
